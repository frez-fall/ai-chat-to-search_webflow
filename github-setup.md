# GitHub Setup Instructions

Follow these exact steps to push your project to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `ai-chat-to-search`
3. **Description:** `AI-powered natural language flight search system using OpenAI and Next.js`
4. **Visibility:** Public (or Private if you prefer)
5. **Important:** DO NOT check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. **Important:** DO NOT check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)
```bash
gh repo create ai-chat-to-search --public --description "AI-powered natural language flight search system"
```

## Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-chat-to-search.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

Go to your GitHub repository URL and verify you see:

‚úÖ **Files that SHOULD be there:**
- README.md
- DEPLOYMENT.md  
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- setup.sh
- backend/ folder with all source code
- frontend/ folder with all source code
- specs/ folder with documentation
- .gitignore file

‚ùå **Files that should NOT be there:**
- backend/.env (contains your API keys)
- frontend/.env.local (contains your API keys)
- node_modules/ folders
- .next/ build folders

## Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Check "Require pull request reviews before merging"
5. Check "Restrict pushes to matching branches"

### Repository Topics
1. Go to your repository main page
2. Click the gear icon next to "About"
3. Add topics: `ai`, `openai`, `nextjs`, `typescript`, `flight-search`, `supabase`

## Step 5: Clone Test

Test that others can clone your repository:

```bash
# In a different directory, test cloning
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-chat-to-search.git
cd ai-chat-to-search
./setup.sh
```

## Your Repository is Now Ready! üéâ

### Benefits You Now Have:

1. **Version Control:** Track all changes
2. **Collaboration:** Others can contribute
3. **Backup:** Code is safely stored on GitHub
4. **Issues:** Track bugs and feature requests
5. **Releases:** Tag versions and create releases
6. **Actions:** Set up CI/CD pipelines
7. **Pages:** Host documentation (optional)

### Next Steps:

1. **Share the Repository:** Send the GitHub URL to collaborators
2. **Set up Continuous Deployment:** Use Vercel, Railway, or GitHub Actions
3. **Create Issues:** Track future improvements
4. **Add Team Members:** Give collaborators access
5. **Set up Monitoring:** Add error tracking and analytics

### Repository URL Format:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-chat-to-search
```

### Commands for Future Development:

```bash
# Make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin main

# Create a new feature branch:
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# ... make changes ...
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Create PR on GitHub

# Pull latest changes:
git pull origin main
```

You're all set! Your AI flight search system is now properly version controlled on GitHub. üöÄ
