# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Natural Language Flight Search

**Feature Branch**: `001-scoping-this-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This feature is to allow users to begin a search by using natural language to begin a flight search. Currently our Homepage > BSS CvR is sitting at 42% which is significantly too low. We have no visibility on why this is the case so it's making it very difficult to gather insights."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear feature description provided - natural language flight search
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Website visitors, customer support agents
   ‚Üí Actions: Natural language input, chat interaction, flight search, URL generation
   ‚Üí Data: Flight preferences, conversations, anonymous user IDs
   ‚Üí Constraints: 2-week minimum departure, IATA codes, specific URL format
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Performance targets and conversation storage duration marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Two clear user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All requirements testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Conversations, search parameters, destinations identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A website visitor wants to search for flights but finds traditional flight search forms overwhelming or doesn't know exactly what they want. They can now type their travel intentions in natural language (e.g., "I want to visit Japan in spring for two weeks") and have an AI assistant guide them through a conversational flow to gather all necessary details, ultimately generating a precise flight search that redirects them to the existing booking system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the homepage, **When** they type "I want to go to Europe next month" and click "Let's go", **Then** a chat modal opens and asks clarifying questions about specific destinations, dates, and passenger details
2. **Given** a user in the chat provides ambiguous location like "London", **When** the AI detects multiple airports, **Then** it asks "Which London airport - Heathrow (LHR), Gatwick (LGW), or Stansted (STN)?" 
3. **Given** a user provides a departure date less than 2 weeks away, **When** the AI validates the date, **Then** it explains Paylater's payment plan requirements and asks for a later date
4. **Given** a user clicks "Let's help you figure it out", **When** they select a travel category, **Then** the chat provides destination recommendations and proceeds with the same conversation flow
5. **Given** the AI has collected all required information, **When** it generates the search parameters, **Then** it displays a "Search Flights" button that redirects to the correct flight search URL
6. **Given** a user asks to speak to customer support during the chat, **When** the AI detects this request, **Then** it directs them to use the orange Intercom button on the page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters nonsensical or non-travel related queries?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during conversation?
- What occurs if the user closes the chat modal mid-conversation?
- How does the system respond to requests for destinations not served by the airline network?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language input in a search box on the homepage
- **FR-002**: System MUST open a chat modal interface when users click "Let's go" or select options from "Let's help you figure it out"
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain a friendly, empathetic, and enthusiastic conversational persona throughout all interactions
- **FR-004**: System MUST convert city and airport names into valid IATA airport codes
- **FR-005**: System MUST ask for clarification when destination names are ambiguous (e.g., multiple airports for same city)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that departure dates are at least 2 weeks in the future
- **FR-007**: System MUST explain Paylater payment plan requirements when users provide dates less than 2 weeks away
- **FR-008**: System MUST collect and validate passenger counts split by adults, children (2-11 years), and infants (under 2 years)
- **FR-009**: System MUST determine cabin class preferences using IATA codes (Y=Economy, S=Premium Economy, C=Business, F=First Class)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support three trip types: return, one-way, and multi-city journeys
- **FR-011**: System MUST generate properly formatted search URLs for the existing Paylater booking system
- **FR-012**: System MUST format dates as YYYY-MM-DD in generated URLs
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate anonymous user IDs for each conversation session
- **FR-014**: System MUST store conversation data in the database
- **FR-015**: System MUST redirect users to customer support via Intercom when they request human assistance
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide destination recommendations when users select guided discovery options
- **FR-017**: System MUST display a "Search Flights" button with the generated URL once all required information is collected

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Chat responses MUST appear within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: response time target not specified - 2 seconds, 5 seconds?]
- **PR-002**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent user limit not specified] simultaneous chat sessions

### Data Requirements  
- **DR-001**: Conversation data MUST be retained for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - 30 days, 1 year, indefinitely?]
- **DR-002**: Anonymous user IDs MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: anonymization method not specified - random UUID, hashed, encrypted?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Conversation**: Represents a complete interaction session including user inputs, AI responses, and generated search parameters. Contains anonymous user ID, timestamp, and conversation completion status
- **Search Parameters**: Contains origin/destination IATA codes, departure/return dates, passenger counts by category, cabin class, and trip type (return/one-way/multi-city)
- **Destination Recommendation**: Represents suggested travel destinations organized by categories (island vibes, mountain views, snowy adventures, city escapes, wine tours, etc.) with associated IATA codes and descriptive content
